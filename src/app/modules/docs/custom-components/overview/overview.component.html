                These custom made components are components that could require heavy modifications depending on the project needs. Also, they are mostly related with the layout
                therefore they located in the <code>src/app/layout/common/</code> directory. You can modify these components without touching the <code>@treo</code> directory.

                These components are not very complex and they only provide some basic features. If you wish them to do more, you have to customize them, and that's exactly why
                they are not located in the <strong>@treo</strong> directory like other components.

                We may add more features and more custom components in the future if they will be beneficial for everyone. Components that are too specific to a project won't be
                included as custom components into Treo!

                Currently, there are five custom components;
